Description — 
Provides an Augmented and Alternative Communication (AAC) system designed to 
assist individuals with speech impairments. Consists of a GUI that shows images and 
speaks out associated text when the image is clicked. The AAC has a main page that 
initially shows all the categories that are on the AAC. When a user clicks on one of the 
category images, it will load a new page of images. When a user clicks on one of these images, 
the text associated with that image is spoken aloud. The user can also create new categories as
needed.

AAC mappings are expected to be in the following format —
imgLocation categoryName
> imgLocation textSpoken
